GitHub Guides Tutorial

Welcome to my coding journey!

I am a former Y2K Project Coordinator / Data Center analyst who is living out my midlife crisis as a Critical Care Paramedic. An opportunity to become an Educator in the hospital system I work in has now brought me back to my love of Data Science.
A lot has changed in the many years since I left, so I have a lot to catch up with!

Come follow along with me as I travel along my #100DaysOfCode path. I'm currently going through MOOCs on Python, R and Web development.

Enjoy!
